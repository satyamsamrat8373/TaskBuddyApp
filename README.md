🌟 TaskBuddy App

TaskBuddy is a ReactJS-based task management application designed to help users efficiently manage their tasks. It supports adding, updating, and deleting tasks, with all data stored locally in the browser for persistent usage.

✨ Features

Add Tasks: Easily add tasks to your task list.
Local Storage: All tasks are stored in the browser's local storage for persistence.
Change Task Status: Mark tasks as complete or incomplete with a single click.
Delete Individual Tasks: Remove specific tasks from the list.
Clear All Tasks: Remove all tasks at once with a single click (button appears only if there is at least one task).
Dynamic Buttons: Each task has "Complete" and "Delete" buttons for streamlined management.

3. Delete Tasks
